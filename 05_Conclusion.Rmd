# Conclusion

In summary, the generalized additive model (GAM) proved its reliability and adaptability, particularly when it used "points" as the target variable. This choice allowed our model to accommodate a wider range of predictor variables, thus improving its ability to capture and decipher the complexities inherent in the dataset. As a result, GAM emerges as the most reliable and robust modeling technique capable of accommodating a wide range of variables, thus providing valuable insights for our analysis. This experience can be leveraged to improve score predictions through the use of socioeconomic and developmental indicators.

In the context of our modeling efforts for both Total Score and Score the various socio-economic and developmental indicators emerged as statistically significant contributors to the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) under consideration. These variables collectively contribute to the complexity of our GAM, with a distinctive and statistically significant impact on the model's ability to understand the variability observed in the respective response variables.

In particular, "Average Years of Schooling" (mys) emphasizes the central role of education in human development, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities. In addition, "Gross National Income per Capita" (Gnipc) emphasizes the critical importance of economic well-being in the broader context of overall development.

In addition, the "Gender Development Index" (GDI) indicates that nations with equitable gender development tend to have higher total scores, underscoring the importance of gender equity in contributing to overall development. Similarly, the "Gender Inequality Index" (GII) highlights the need to address and reduce gender-based inequality, given its substantial influence on Total Scores. Taken together, these results underscore the intricate interplay between socioeconomic and development factors and their respective response variables, shedding light on the multifaceted nature of human development.
